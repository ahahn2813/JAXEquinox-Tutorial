# JAXEquinox-Tutorial
Tutorial-style exploration of neural network construction using JAX and Equinox, emphasizing functional programming and differentiable computing.

## Overview
This repository contains tutorials and examples illustrating how to build neural networks using JAX and Equinox, with emphasis on functional programming, automatic differentiation, and performance-aware design.

## Motivation
Modern ML frameworks increasingly rely on differentiable programming paradigms. This project explores:
* The differences and similarities of `jax.numpy` and `numpy`
* Vectorized functions (`.vmap`)
* Functional representations of neural networks
* Automatic differentiation
* JIT compilation for performance
The goal is to understand how and why these tools work, not just how to use them.

## Install
`pip install jax jaxlib equinox numpy`

## Usage
* Run example notebooks or scripts
* Modify architectures and training loops
* Compare design patterns to more traditional frameworks

## Tools
* Python
* JAX
* Equinox
* NumPy

## Intended Audience
Students, researchers, and practitioners interested in modern machine learning tooling and theory-informed implementation.

## Materials
The Jupyter Notebook is an all inclusive tutorial providing examples, descriptions, and motivations.
